- Get alsa output to work again
    (I guess it broke after an update? Also the
     file format changed a bit, kbps and stuff)
- Add sound sample rotation for each key
- Figure out the latency Problem, when pressing
  keys pretty fast.
- Make sound file format handling more robust
- Enable loading of more audio file input formats
- Add console only key input
- Make input readers and sound output more robust,
  e.g. make them reinitialize the sound library if
  there is a problem.
- Add more documentation *g*
